wget http://www-us.apache.org/dist/kafka/0.10.2.1/kafka_2.10-0.10.2.1.tgz
tar xzvf kafka_2.10-0.10.2.1.tgz

Navigate to kafka_2.10-0.10.2.1/config, modify zookeeper.properties - 
        and add the following in the file
server.1=10.128.0.2:2888:3888 
initLimit=6
syncLimit=3
	
Navigate	to kafka_2.10-0.10.2.1/config, modify server.properties- 
and add the following
port=9092
host.name=10.128.0.2
and change the following
broker.id=0
num.partitions=4
zookeeper.connect=<InternalIp>:2181

Start zookeeper (paths relative to kafka_2.10-0.10.2.1 folder) by executing    following command and it will keep running
sudo bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties


Open the new console as in above image and to start kafka (paths relative to kafka_2.10-0.10.2.1 folder) run the following command in new console
sudo bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties


Open the new console as above image and create omniture topic by running following command
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic omniture –zookeeper 10.128.0.2:2181 --partitions 4 --replication-factor 1	

For Testing - Consume data using Kafka Console consumer
sudo bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --zookeeper 10.128.0.2:2181 --topic omniture --from-beginning
